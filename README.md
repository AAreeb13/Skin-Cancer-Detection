# Skin-Cancer-Detection

## About

## Guide

1. Make sure you have pip and python installed
2. run *python -m venv venv* for Windows or *python3 -m venv venv* for linux/macOS
3. Activate your Virtual Environment with:
    *source venv/bin/activate*  # macOS/Linux
    *.\venv\Scripts\activate*   # Windows
4. run *pip install -r requirements.txt*



## Plan
Preprocessing: rotating, cropping, balancing dataset
make images bigger to make new images

Neural Network:


Evaluation:  does he have skin cancer or not
then do go doctor or not /softmax

what kind of evaluation matrix are we going to implement

Neural Networks or Decision Trees

Python -> Pytorch
	has neural network library.
	has pre-processing libraries.
	softmax
